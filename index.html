            <h4>The Colisseum, Rome, Italy</h4>
            <p>The Colosseum is the great oval amphitheater in the center of Rome where gladiators once fought for their
                lives. The
                largest amphitheater ever built, it was constructed from sand and stone over eight years, from 72 to 80
                CE. The colossal
                structure could hold 80,000 spectators, arranged in a circular ring around the central stage.</p>

            <h4>The Great Wall of China</h4>
            <p>The Great Wall of China is a huge barrier that spans thousands of miles along China’s historic northern
                border. Created
                over millennia, the wall began its life as a series of smaller walls dating back to the 7th century BCE,
                built as
                protective barriers against nomadic raids. In 220 BCE, China’s first Emperor, Qin Shi Huang masterminded
                the unification
                of all China’s walls into one almighty barrier, strengthening and extending the wall to keep out
                northern invaders.
                Today, the wall is recognized as one of the seven wonders, which, including all its branches, measures a
                whopping 13,171
                miles</p>

            <h4>The Taj Mahal</h4>
            <p>India’s renowned Taj Mahal (Persian for Crown of Palaces) is the stunning white marble mausoleum on the
                bank of the
                Yamuna River in the city of Agra, and it has been selected as one of the seven wonders of the world.
                Mughal emperor Shah
                Jahan built the temple as a tomb for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631.
                A marble tomb
                in the center is surrounded by 42 acres of grounds, where gardens, a mosque, a guest house, and a pool
                complete the
                complex. The entire project took over 22 years to complete by 20,000 workers at a cost of 32 million
                rupees (around
                US$827 million by today’s standards). But the hard work paid off – today, the Taj Mahal is recognized as
                a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site and a vital component of India’s rich Mughal history</p>

            <h4>Christ the Redeemer, Brazil</h4>
            <p>The totemic statue of Christ the Redeemer stands over Rio de Janeiro on the top of Mount Corcovado. At 30
                meters tall,
                this monument is an iconic emblem of Brazil. This huge public artwork was designed by the Polish-French
                sculptor Paul
                Landowski in the 1920s and completed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and French engineer
                Albert Caquot in
                1931. Made from reinforced concrete clad in over 6 million soapstone tiles, Christ the Redeemer is the
                largest Art Deco
                sculpture in the world. Built just after the end of the First World War, the sculpture was an
                overpowering symbol of
                Christianity and hope when the world had been brought to its knees, so it is no surprise that this
                monument made the
                list of today’s seven wonders.</p>

            <h4>Machu Picchu, Peru</h4>
            <p>Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the 15th century, a rare citadel discovered high in the Andes
                mountains above the
                Peruvian Sacred Valley. Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact,
                featuring evidence
                of former plazas, temples, agricultural terraces and homes. Archaeologists believe the citadel was built
                as an estate
                for the Inca emperor Pachacuti in around 1450 in polished drystone walls. The Incas abandoned the site a
                century later
                and it remained hidden for millennia before being brought to public attention by American historian
                Hiram Bingham in
                1911. Because of this remarkable preservation, it is recognized today as one of the seven wonders</p>

            <h4>Chichén Itzá, Mexico</h4>
            <p>Deep in the Mexican state of Yucatán lies Chichen Itza, a historic Mayan city built between the 9th and
                12th centuries.
                Constructed by the pre-Columbian Mayan tribe Itzá, the city includes a series of monuments and temples.
                The most
                celebrated is El Castillo, also known as the Temple of Kukulcan. It is a huge step pyramid in the center
                of the city
                which was built as a devotional temple to the god Kukulkan. In total, the entire temple features 365
                steps, one for each
                day of the year. Even more impressively, during the spring and summer equinoxes, the afternoon sun casts
                triangular
                shadows down the pyramid’s north stairway that resemble a feathered serpent slithering down its surface,
                heading towards
                a stone snake head at the base – no wonder it is one of the seven wonders today!</p>

            <h4>Petra, Jordan</h4>
            <p>Petra, the ancient city in southern Jordan, is also known as the ‘rose city’ for its golden hue. It dates
                as far back as
                312 BCE. Set in a remote valley, this ancient city was founded by the Arab Nabataeans, a sophisticated
                civilization that
                carved stunning architecture and complex waterways out of surrounding rock faces. The Nabateans also
                established Petra
                as a successful trade hub, earning vast wealth and a booming population before being wiped out by
                earthquakes. Unknown
                to the Western world for centuries, the city was uncovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig
                Burckhardt.
                19th-century poet and scholar John William Burgon described Petra as “a rose-red city half as old as
                time.</p>
